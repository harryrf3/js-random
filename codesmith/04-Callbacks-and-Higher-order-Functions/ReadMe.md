## Callbacks and Higher-order Functions


In this unit we explore higher order functions and callbacks. Functions like map, reduce and filter are powerful tools and keep our code DRY but can be complex to navigate. We will learn how to build these functions from scratch so you can easily implement and debug them in your code.
